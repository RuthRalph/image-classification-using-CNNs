The other image classification used MLP, among its limitations, it flatten images into long 1D vectors before it can be fed to the network. Thus, the model loses all sense of locality and spatial hierarchy.  Why CNNs? Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed for structured grid-like data like images.

What I did here: i exploreD two classical CNNs that laid the foundation for modern deep vision (LeNet & AlexNet):
Implement LeNet — one of the earliest CNNs, by Yann LeCun.
Build a simplified AlexNet — a deeper network that won ImageNet 2012.
